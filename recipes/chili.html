    <p>Chili is a spicy stew of Mexican origin containing chili peppers (sometimes in the form of chili powder), meat
        (usually beef), tomatoes, and often pinto beans or kidney beans.[2] Other seasonings may include garlic, onions,
        and cumin.</p>
    <p>The types of meat and other ingredients used vary based on geographic and personal tastes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>

        <li>(15 ounce) can chili beans, not drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste</li>
